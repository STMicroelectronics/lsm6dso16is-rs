# LSM6DSO16IS Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Temperature Data Polling on STM32F401RE Nucleo (Embassy Executor)

This example demonstrates how to configure and read accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature data from the **LSM6DSO16IS** inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor using an **STM32F401RE** microcontroller board with the **Embassy** asynchronous executor framework. The sensor is configured to output data at 12.5 Hz in high-performance mode, and the program polls the sensor for new data, printing the results over UART.

## Hardware Setup

- **Microcontroller Board:** STM32F401RE Nucleo-64
- **Sensor:** LSM6DSO16IS 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope with temperature sensor
- **Communication Interface:** I2C1 at 100 kHz Standard Mode
- **UART:** USART2 for serial output at 115200 baud

### Default Pin Configuration

| Signal       | STM32F401RE Pin | Description                      |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| I2C1_SCL     | PB8             | I2C clock line (open-drain)     |
| I2C1_SDA     | PB9             | I2C data line (open-drain)      |
| USART2_TX    | PA2             | UART transmit for debug output  |

The LSM6DSO16IS sensor is connected to the STM32F401RE via the I2C1 peripheral on pins PB8 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA). UART output is routed through PA2 for serial communication.

## Code Description

### Initialization

- The program initializes STM32F401RE peripherals including clocks, GPIO pins, I2C, and UART using the Embassy HAL.
- I2C1 is configured for 100 kHz Standard Mode with open-drain pins PB8 and PB9.
- USART2 is configured on PA2 at 115200 baud for serial output.

### Sensor Configuration

- The LSM6DSO16IS sensor is initialized over I2C with the low I2C address.
- The device ID is read and verified to confirm sensor presence.
- The sensor is reset to default configuration.
- Data-ready signals for accelerometer and gyroscope are routed to INT1 pin.
- Block Data Update (BDU) is recommended but commented out in this example.
- Accelerometer and gyroscope output data rates are set to 12.5 Hz in high-performance mode.
- Accelerometer full scale is set to ±2g.
- Gyroscope full scale is set to ±2000 dps.
- Filtering chain configuration is available but disabled by default.

### Data Acquisition Loop

- The program polls data-ready flags for accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature.
- When new data is available, raw sensor data is read and converted to physical units:
  - Acceleration in mg (milli-g)
  - Angular rate in mdps (milli-degrees per second)
  - Temperature in degrees Celsius
- Converted data is printed over UART.
- The loop includes a 1-second delay between iterations.

## Usage

1. Connect the LSM6DSO16IS sensor to the STM32F401RE Nucleo board via I2C on pins PB8 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA).
2. Build and flash the Rust firmware onto the STM32F401RE.
3. Open a serial terminal at 115200 baud on the USART2 TX pin (PA2).
4. Observe accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature data printed every second over UART.

## Notes

- This example uses polling to read sensor data without interrupts.
- Block Data Update (BDU) is recommended to ensure data consistency during reads.
- Filtering chain configuration is available but disabled by default.
- The environment is `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` for embedded Rust applications.
- Panic behavior is set to halt on panic (`panic_halt`).
